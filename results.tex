We have collected 133 unique versions of the ``win32k.sys'' driver binary, and
downloaded PDB files for these samples. We then generated assembler templates
for many struct fields and ran these templates over these binaries in our
collections.

Figure \ref{win32k_structs} shows a summary of struct offsets across different
versions of the win32k driver. As can be seen the struct offsets are generally
not changed between major and minor binary versions, although they do vary
between each minor version.

Simiarly Figure \ref{win32k_constants} shows that global constants vary wildly
from build to build, hence version number alone is insufficient to provide
reliable offsets for these constants.
